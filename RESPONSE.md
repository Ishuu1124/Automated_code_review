Evaluating .tf files from: sample_tf
============================================================

--- Simple RAG ---
Here are the issues found in the provided Terraform configuration file (variables.tf) along with recommendations:

1. **Insecure API Key Storage**
   - Issue: Storing sensitive information like API keys directly in the code is a security risk.
   - Recommendation: Use environment variables, IBM Cloud Vault, or other secure methods to store and manage sensitive data.

2. **Default Values for Variables**
   - Issue: Default values for variables like `ibmcloud_api_key` are set to "PLACEHOLDER\_API\_KEY", which is not a secure practice.
   - Recommendation: Remove or replace default values with appropriate placeholders (e.g., `null`, `"-"`, or `"--set-plain"`) and handle them in the main configuration file or use modules that provide default values.

3. **Variable Type for `vpc_name`**
   - Issue: The type for `vpc_name` is set to `string`, which allows any value, including invalid ones (e.g., non-alphanumeric characters).
   - Recommendation: Update the type to a more restrictive one, such as `regex(^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$)` or use a list of allowed values, to ensure valid input for this variable.

4. **Description for Variables**
   - Issue: While descriptions are provided for most variables, it's essential to keep them up-to-date and accurate.
   - Recommendation: Review and update variable descriptions as needed to ensure they accurately reflect the purpose and expected values of each variable.

5. **Consistency in Variable Naming**
   - Issue: Some variables have different naming conventions (e.g., `enable_logging` uses camelCase, while others use snake\_case).
   - Recommendation: Choose a consistent naming convention (either camelCase or snake\_case) and apply it uniformly across all variables to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the updated variables.tf file with recommended changes:

```hcl
variable "ibmcloud_api_key" {
  description = "API key for IBM Cloud access"
  type        = string
  default     = null  # Remove or replace with a secure placeholder
}

variable "region" {
  description = "IBM Cloud region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-south"
}

variable "resource_group" {
  description = "Resource group name"
  type        = string
  default     = "Default"
}

variable "vpc_name" {
  description = "Virtual Private Cloud name"  # Update description
  type        = regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$")  # Add type restriction
}

variable "enable_logging" {
  description = "Enable logging for services"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}
```
